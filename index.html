                <div>
                    I am an undergraduate student in electrical and computer engineering based at the University of Seoul. I am especially interested in mathematical optimization for machine learning and optimal control for robotics. I always strive to maintain a sense of balance between theory and implementation.

            <div>Our team developed cardiovascular diagnosing device and personalized management solution using InBody data at the 2023 Makerton, organized by Inbody. As a result, we was awarded the Excellence Prize and a prize of 2 million KRW. I developed a CNN model for ECG sensor data collection, noise reduction, and normalization. This model was then integrated with InBody data to create a machine learning algorithm for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases.</div>

            <div>Excellence Prize at AI Object recognition-based Solar Tracking Robot Challenge held by Engineering Education Innovation Center of KOREA University</div>
            <div>I achieved a record time of 80 seconds and received an Excellence Award at an AI object recognition-based solar tracking robot competition. The goal of the competition was to complete the given task as quickly as possible without crossing the boundary lines while following a designated path. I focused on the efficient integration of hardware and software, developing a driving algorithm based on the amount of light. This approach allowed me to solve the problem of the robot occasionally crossing the boundary lines.</div>
