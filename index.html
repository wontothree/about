            <div>Hi, This is Anthony Garcia (or Sewon Kim).</div>
            <div>I am an undergraduate student in electrical and computer engineering based at the University of Seoul.</div>
            <div>I am especially interested in mathematical optimization and optimal control for robotics.</div>
            <div>I strive to maintain a sense of balance between theory and implementation.</div>

            <h3>[01/05/2024-01/31/2025] InBody AI Scale</h3>
            <div>As the SW & Vision AI Team Leader, I have developed a computer vision AI solution for the new InBody Scale AI product. This involved researching and enhancing the performance of height estimation algorithms using a low-performance monocular camera and limited computing resources. Additionally, I developed a face verification solution, along with the necessary pipeline and database for it.</div>
            <div>Existing height estimation algorithms and papers using vision assume that the user's entire body is within the camera's field of view. However, due to the mechanical characteristics of the InBody device, the user's full body does not fit within the camera's field of view. Our attempt to estimate height under these conditions is unprecedented. In our first experiment, we achieved an average error of 0.6% and a maximum error of 1%. We tackled the ultimate problem of height estimation by breaking it down into sub-problems where computer vision AI can excel: Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation. To achieve this, we designed and utilized a structure that allows the camera to move via motors and rails.</div>

            <div>2023 Inbody Makerthon held by Inbody Co., Ltd</div>
            <div>Excellence Prize</div>
            <div>Our team developed cardiovascular diagnosing device and personalized management solution using InBody data at the 2023 Makerton, organized by Inbody. As a result, we was awarded the Excellence Prize and a prize of 2 million KRW. I developed a CNN model for ECG sensor data collection, noise reduction, and normalization. This model was then integrated with InBody data to create a machine learning algorithm for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases.</div>

            <div>AI Object recognition-based Solar Tracking Robot Challenge held by Engineering Education Innovation Center of KOREA University</div>
            <div>Excellence Prize</div>
            <div>I achieved a record time of 80 seconds and received an Excellence Award at an AI object recognition-based solar tracking robot competition. The goal of the competition was to complete the given task as quickly as possible without crossing the boundary lines while following a designated path. I focused on the efficient integration of hardware and software, developing a driving algorithm based on the amount of light. This approach allowed me to solve the problem of the robot occasionally crossing the boundary lines.</div>
